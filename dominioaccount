Your new Droplet is all set to go! You can access it using the following credentials:

Droplet Name: ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-sfo2-01-horizons
IP Address: 165.22.136.145
Username: root
Password: 59d98e3d46b35bc6e6e07f91cb

For security reasons, you will be required to change this Droplet’s root password when you login. You should choose a strong password that will be easy for you to remember, but hard for a computer to guess. You might try creating an alpha-numerical phrase from a memorable sentence (e.g. “I won my first spelling bee at age 7,” might become “Iwm#1sbaa7”). Random strings of common words, such as “Mousetrap Sandwich Hospital Anecdote,” tend to work well, too.

As an added security measure, we also strongly recommend adding an SSH key to your account. You can do that here: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/security?i=531b28

Once added, you can select your SSH key and use it when creating future Droplets. This eliminates the need for root passwords altogether, and makes your Droplets much less vulnerable to attack.

Happy Coding,
Team DigitalOcean
