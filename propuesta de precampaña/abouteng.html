              <h2>The Tutorial Program Explained and Its Benefits</h2>
                <div class="conten-par">
                    <p>
                        First, the student will receive 25 hours of instructions during the market’s trading
                 hours, while sitting next to the tutor. The first 20 hours would be dedicated to
                 watching the tutor trade while explaining the market’s actions. The last 5 hours
                 would be the most thrilling, with the student applying his trading skills using a
                 Charles Schwab trading simulator, while the tutor rates his progress. The 25 hours
                 may be completed over a 5-week period by doing 5 hour lessons once a week.
                 Some students could prefer doing two 5 hour lessons once a week, for completion
                 in 2 and a half weeks. Other calendar schedules may be accommodated to suit the
                 student’s time requirements.
                 At the completion of the 25-hour stock trading course, a watch list containing 20
                 stock picks will be provided to the student. This is a list of tradable stocks with
                 proper chart formations, for the student to be able to execute winning trades
                 following the rules learned. Furthermore, the student will receive two new stock
                 picks every week to add to his trading watch list. As part of this program, the
                 student will receive free trading consultation using a chat line or via Wasapp, for a
                 period of 3 months after completion of the course.
                 The cost of the stock trading program tutorial is $2,500.00 for USA residents. Payments of $500.00
                 is to be made five days in advance of the first scheduled class. The student can elect to stop taking the course at any time by giving a 5-day notice of his intentions to cancel training. A
                 deposit of $500 is required to register for the course to be kept in an escrow
                 account. The deposit shall be forfeited upon the student not showing for the first or subsequent lessons.
                 For other countries, fees and payments shall be determined based upon the cost of living. For instance, for Colombia, fees are set at 50% of the cost of the course for USA residents.

              <h2>Short Term Stock Trading Definitions and Objectives</h2>
                <div class="conten-par">
              <p>TShort term trading, in our personal approach to stock market wealth
                 creation, is buying and selling stocks within a time period of one to twenty
                 trading days. Fast gains opportunities at making money come up almost
                 daily. Following daily charts one can spot an early forming trend, allowing
                 the trader to capture profits of five to twenty percent during the trading
                 course of the day or over a two-day trading period. Swing trading (look up
                 the definition at Google) is best suited for short periods of two to three
                 days. Trend trading, (look up at Google again) is to be followed over longer
                 periods of time. In term trading we advocate following a trend for no more
                 than 20 trading days, to insure locking in profits. Markets can turn against
                 the trader along the way, taking away a good part of the profits. The hallmark of a
                 good trader is knowing his exit points for capturing good profits. Our
                 tutoring course will teach you these skills for making good trades, at the
                 least risk for the highest possible returns.</p>
